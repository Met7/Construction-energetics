Instructions for use of the SW are at the end of the original bc thesis.

Included is a sheet with a list of literature and all extracted data and worksheets.
The second sheet, "SW data", can be used to generate the cost data for the SW. Export this sheet (add data, replace..) and run the attached Python script on it. It will crate files to be added to the data/technologies folder of the SW.
